		<ul>
			<li>Star Wars
			<li>Mr. PotatoHead
			<li>Music
			<li>And <strong>anything</strong> that might appeal to my inner 5th - 7th grader	
		</ul>

	<h2>Questions I Am Often Asked</h2>
    <dt><em>Why do you have a beard?  Don't get me wrong it looks great, but why?</em></dt>
    <dd>I have a weak chin.  My chin is so weak that if I didn't have a beard you would want to punch me in the face.  Who wants that?  Not you.  Not me.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt><em>Are you still bitter that beloved actor, Alan Tudyk (Firefly, Knight's Tale and Dodgeball) is listed as "Most Likely to Succeed" for Lon Morris College in 1991 on his IMDB profile?</em></dt>
    <dd>There are no hard feelings (even if <em>I</em> was the person voted "Most Likely to Succeed that year).  Alan <em>was</em> voted "Most Talented" and "Sophmore Beau".  Even though I have the yearbook to prove my claim, it would be hard to argue that Alan would not have been a better choice. </dd>

	<h2>My <em>Dream</em> Vehicle</h2>
	<p> If you were to buy me a car, the 1963 Ferarri 250 GTO is on the top of my list. But you can’t 			actually buy one. Although one recently sold for the price of $52 million, there are none for sale.
		<br>
		So how does this 50-year-old Italian stallion come to cost more than some countries? Well, for starters there are only 39 of them. So they are quite rare.
		<br>
		Also each one is a bit different. They are handcrafted – and not in the modern sense in that some technician carefully screwed together some 3D-printed components. But rather in the sense of an actual florid Italian hand hammering the gorgeous aluminum bodywork.
