	<h2>Questions I Am Often Asked</h2>
    <dt><em>Why do you have a beard?  Don't get me wrong it looks great, but why?</em></dt>
    <dd>I have a weak chin.  My chin is so weak that if I didn't have a beard you would want to punch me in the face.  Who wants that?  Not you.  Not me.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt><em>Are you still bitter that beloved actor, Alan Tudyk (Firefly, Knight's Tale and Dodgeball) is listed as "Most Likely to Succeed" for Lon Morris College in 1991 on his IMDB profile?</em></dt>
    <dd>There are no hard feelings (even if <em>I</em> was the person voted "Most Likely to Succeed that year).  Alan <em>was</em> voted "Most Talented" and "Sophmore Beau".  Even though I have the yearbook to prove my claim, it would be hard to argue that Alan would not have been a better choice. </dd>
